Simple.</li>\n\t<li>Hunger: The success behind this diet is that it helps you stick to a low calorie diet (1000-1200 calories/day) without feeling hungry. Of course it takes a few days to adjust to the change in diet, but after that the cookies really suppress your hunger and help you stick to the diet without those pesky hunger pangs.</li>\n\t<li>Afterwards: Once goal weight achieved, eat healthy meals and enjoy the cookies as a healthy, low calorie, hunger suppressing snack between meals so you don&#39;t over eat.</li>\n\t<li>Proof: This diet is not a fad, it has been going strong and only growing by word of mouth for the last 40 years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In depth:</p>\n\n\n<p>The reason this diet is so effective is because it trains your body to eat the way its suppose to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weight Loss Phase:</strong> 9 Cookies a Day, 1 or 2 cookies every 2 hours (do not exceed 2 hours) + Dinner (250g lean meat plus salad/veggies) + Light exercise (20-30min walk, 2-3 times a week)</p>\n\n<p>A lot people don&#39;t eat for 5 or 6 hours, then have a big meal, and that causes the weight to pile on. In the weight losing phase, Dr. Siegal&#39;s Cookie Diet trains your body to eat small portions frequently, this helps spike your metabolism throughout the day and facilitates weight loss. It also helps you get used to preparing one healthy meal per day (dinner).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The reason you WILL BE successful is 3 fold:</strong>\n\t<br>1. You don&#39;t feel hungry so you can stick to this low calorie diet\n\t<br>2. The diet super simple &amp; convenient, so it is easy for you to stick to it\n\t<br>3. You will be equipped to enter the weight maintenance stage</p>\n\n<p><strong>Weight Maintenance Phase</strong>: Healthy Breakfast, Lunch &amp; Dinner, 1-2 cookies inbetween meals + Moderate exercise (30-40 minutes of exercise, 2-3 times a week)</p>\n\n<p>After you reach your goal weight you move to the maintenance phase. Now that your body is accustomed to eating small, frequent portions, you have had practice preparing healthy meals and you also have got into the routine of doing some light exercise, you are now prepared to scale that up slightly to prepare 3 healthy meals (can be found in our <a href=\"https://www.cookiediet.com.au/products/the-cookie-diet-cookbook\">cookbook</a>), and increase your exercise. The cookies you will eat in between your meals will help curb your sweet tooth and help control your hunger so you don&#39;t over eat.</p>",

There are people that choose to use them as a healthy snack alternative. However if you are interested in how Dr. Siegal has been using them in the U.S below are the details</p>\n\n<p>The purpose of the cookies is to control your hunger so you can stick to a reduced-calorie diet. They contain a particular mixture of proteins, derived from various food substances, that Dr. Siegal has been personally making in his Miami bakery since 1975. There are no drugs or added stimulants in the products.</p>\n\n<p>The way Dr. Siegal designed it, and has been using it on over 500, 000 patients over the last 37 years is to have <strong>1 to 2 cookies every 2 hours plus dinner</strong><strong>.</strong></p>\n\n<p>For dinner, you have 500 to 700 calories. As a guide we recommend <strong>250g of lean meat (chicken, fish, lamb) plus salad/veggies.</strong></p>\n\n\n<li>Overall you will have 1000-1200 calories a day.</li>\n<li>Each cookie has only 60 calories.</li>\n<li>It is advised to take a daily multivitamin (any brand) and at least 8 glasses of water.</li>\n<li>Tea and coffee is allowed (avoid milk, cream and sugar if possible &ndash; sweeteners are allowed)</li>\n\n<p>The first few days will take you some time to adjust to the change in diet, but usually after 2-4 days you will find it very easy and convenient to follow.</p>\n\n<p>The following table shows the Dr. Siegal&#39;s Eating Plan. This timetable will work for most people who have a typical workday schedule. It assumes that you wake up at around 7am, work from 9pm to 5pm or so, have dinner around 8pm, and go to bed around 11pm. It also assumes that you will have your one &ldquo;real&rdquo; meal in the evening (but you can adjust the time to suit your lifestyle). Under this plan, you never go more than two hours without eating in order to reduce the opportunity for serious hunger to develop.</p>\n\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n\n\t<p><strong>8 AM:</strong> 2 cookies (120 calories) <strong>10 AM:</strong> 1 cookie (60 calories)</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>NOON:</strong> 1 cookie (60 calories) <strong>2 PM:</strong> 1 cookie (60 calories)</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>4 PM:</strong> 2 cookies (120 calories) <strong>6 PM:</strong> 1 cookie (60 calories)</p>\n\n\t<p><strong>8 PM:</strong> DINNER (500-700 calories) <strong>10 PM</strong>: 1 cookies (60 calories)</p>\n</div>\n\n<p>If you have any more questions please don&#39;t hesitate to call us on 1300 077 707</p>",
